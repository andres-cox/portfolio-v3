Looking for movies by actor and check if they have awards and nominations. I also wanted to check if they were available in streaming platforms for that I use Justwatch API but unfortunatly we can use it only in local do to its CORS policy.",

When I checked its documentation I saw that it was very organized and it had most of the functionality I was looking for, movie details, recomendations, actor movies and so on. Then I realized that it hasn't have actor's tvshows as a basic query so I had to implement a search query, that has its disadvantage, because the response isn't quite clean and I had to make some filters in order to have the results I was expecting. I finished all the app based in just this API, then I wanted to move forward to implement nominations details and streaming availability that this API don't offer.",

Before this API I was looking for a more specific API for movie nominations but I couldn't find a good one. So I decided to use Wikipedia because is like an open encyclopedia, and maybe it'll be useful for another future project. When I look more deep into it, I saw that it has multiple queries and it hasn't have as good examples as I wanted, but well it's just a new tool to learn so I studied all its options and finally I could create the query I wanted, the one that returns movie nominations. But it's not as clean as I would like, because in order to exact table of a movie page I have to request two queries. One for seeking nominations section and the other to extract the html of that table, there is a way to do it in just one query but now it comes the second problem, I look for movie queries based in its title (tmdb title) because there isn't id relation, so we have the title and it works for most of the movies, but for those that don't, we have to create another query, you can see in the image the queries I had to create in order to have most of the movies nominations details. I still think it's not a clean solution but it works, and that is all I wanted.",

I found this <a>resource</a> an it's a basic API it doesn't offer too much info about the queries but it informs a way to use it. Once studied I was looking a way to implement it by TMDb ids, but there isn't a specific query for this, even though it has an 'TMDb id' attribute, I was testing to do it but unfortunatly it couldn't be possible because of the limited queries, instead I went for the search funtion by title and interesting it matches quiet fine in every search. So this works, there is a problem when it does not find the movie and thats why I double check the response with the initial title to be sure about the result. Although this only works in a local enviroment an it's not available for production do to its CORS policy",

Most of the time REST APIs build queries and in the frontend, when we use it we get some unnecessary data that we can't avoid, so with the response we select the attributes and create some filters. With GraphQL this is easier because its queries are customizable and we get the data we really need preventing unnecessary code in the frontend.",

With the backend implemented we just can use custom queries in the places we needed and NgRx might not be useful this time. But there is a part in the Web in which we need a filter employees for a search event and doing this with queries isn't quiet clean in my opinion, there is a little flash everytime with emit that event. So I went for the complex way, and I research a lot to find a way to join Apollo and NgRx, there wasn't good enogh documentation or examples until I found a code in stackblitz that implements it. The solution is linking ApolloClient cache with NgRx cache, with this finally we can see the data again with NgRx and customize the web with our needs. Now with these useful tools. And there isn't flashing problems with the search functionality. Now it's very fast and smooth.",
