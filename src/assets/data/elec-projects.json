The left and the right would be elevator, the front a travalinera and the back just a ligth. <br><br> All parts should have a servo to have another degree of freedom. and a motor DC for the elevator and the travalinera. The assembling part took the longest, welding and creating the main board. Each light should have 3 leds for Red Green Blue format and also 1 black light in the bottom. To have control for all lights and motors we needed 2 Arduino Mega the main need was the PWA signals and the analog inputs. <br><br>Of course there are chips that solves these problems but he didn't want to overcomplicate the control part since he had 2 Arduino and he wanted to divide the project in 2 parts. Once all finished while testing everything with a basic program there was problem that delayed the project a bit. There was a problem with the long wires.",

                    "text": "Because of the long wires the PWA signals of the Arduino weren't reaching fine to the motors and created a bad performance that even manipulate the lights. This was an unexpected problem, we create a small prototype because we though there was a short-circuit, but there wasn't and in this small prototype we put a long wire and it was working fine. Sergio at this time was spiritless, because it took too much time and money to reach this point. <br><br>We though there should be a problem in the main board, taking out some parts of it and cutting a bit the wires we could se that an elevator was working fine. But assempling all there was the problem again. <br><br>Sincerely I couldn't find what in the board was causing this, maybe some interference between wires  because of the high voltage? but there was a clear issue, PWA signals for the motors and lights weren't working fine. So instead of looking what was wrong I started thinking how can I solve that problem. <br><br>Unfortunately I didn't have an Oscilloscope to watch what signal was reaching the motor, at the beginning I though there was a problem with the arduino, with its timer, but it wasn't that. By studying and discarding problems I bet on a solution, I used an optocoupler at the entrance of the signal in the motor this might recreate the PWA signal from 5V again and it worked!!! We didn't get this problem again. <br><br> I must highlight this problem from others because it really affectet Sergio's willing. Without solving it we couldn't reach what Sergio was imaginating all the time while building this project.",

Controlling multiple elements for just one movement, there was a lot of code. So I created functions to manage it better, and then created a library to move all the unnecessary code that Sergio didn't need to touch. <br><br> Eventually with the guide of Sergio, I created a confortable library for him that could be call as an artistic language because now he has to learn how to use this new tool in an artistic way and show in the stage what he is imaginating and what he wants to share. <br><br> To interact with the sound we use the time function of the Arduino, and trigger movements and lights based in a timeline. We wanted to use an mp3 module in order to have more control but the Sound quality was not good enough for Sergio. So we trigger the timer from the earphone jack of an IPod.",

This was an unvaluable experience, I think the main purpose when working with someone is to make the other feel the same desire that you want to achieve, the same goal. I felt that while working with Sergio. Now he is in another stage of the project, the artistic part, like practice an instrument to perform a song. He needs to find a way to use this new project as a tool in his events, so he is testing lights and position with his music and upgrading mechanical parts of it."

It can't trigger multiple sounds at once, this was a problem that can be solved with a sound triggered module. But Adriana didn't knew it and these modules are not sold in Bolivia, she brought it from Mexico. <br><br> There was a way to create an own one. But she didn't want to spend more time and money in that again, as we have the previous circuit that was working and there were multiple problems beside that one. <br><br> The second problem was a big one, one day before the presentation, at night we test the circuit with the mural and it was not working, Adriana literally wanted to die. Because she was promoting the event days before. So I had about less than 15 hours to solve it. <br><br> That was really difficult, this time a had the oportunity to test with the mural and I tryed hard to find the problem, there was a ground problem in the outside, but why? it worked in a wall inside and in an piece of wood. I noticed that putting the charger in my laptop, it presents different values but still are usable, with the mural there was no usable values there was a noise aspect that we were not aware before. The time passed and I couldn't find a solution, so I decided to test the software part creating a filter and modifying the values just to have some usable sensors. And with some modifiers I could make the mural sound but it was not clean and it was randomly triggered, there wasn't more time I Adriana decided to present it, at least there was sound but it wasn't an instrument. <br><br> Days after I present Adriana to a friend because I had to travel, and with him and more time, they could solve the problem, but at last Adriana decided to don't leave it for the public, because the conductive paint wasn't able to survive the rain. And she just decided to recreate it for another project indoors.",
